This folder contains my final project for my DAT202 class. 
It involves looking at datasets about heart disease and stroke.


Description of Files (the bolded file is the most important one):

Final.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook with most of the code for this project  
**Final.pdf - Written report**  
Perry_Antonelli_DAT202_Final_Presentation.pptx - PowerPoint presentation of final project
US_Heart_Patients.csv - raw dataset
multitest.py - python fiel with the rest of code (a portion of the code runs in parallel and to get it to work one of the functions needed to be in a separate file)
