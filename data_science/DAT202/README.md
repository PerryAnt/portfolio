This folder contains my final project for my DAT202 class. 
It involves looking at datasets about heart disease and stroke.


Description of Files (the bolded file is the most important one):

**DAT202_Final.pdf - Written report for this project**  
Final.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook with most of the code for this project  
Perry_Antonelli_DAT202_Final_Presentation.pptx - PowerPoint presentation of final project  
US_Heart_Patients.csv - raw dataset  
multitest.py - python file with the rest of code (a portion of the code runs in parallel and to get it to work one of the functions needed to be in a separate file)
